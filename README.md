# Rock Paper Scissors
Source code for a Rock Paper Scissors game.

This project is used to run a simple game, all contained within one Python file.

I implemented functionality in Python that uses a series of functions and classes to play Rock Paper Scissors against 
a number of oppenents that utilize different strategies.
